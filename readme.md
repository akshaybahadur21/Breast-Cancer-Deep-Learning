This code helps you classify malignant and benign tumors using Deep Learning.

## Code Requirements 🦄
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

## Description 🧪
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Deep learning models are loosely related to information processing and communication patterns in a biological nervous system, such as neural coding that attempts to define a relationship between various stimuli and associated neuronal responses in the brain.

## Python  Implementation 👨‍🔬

1) Dataset- UCI-ML
2) I have used 30 features to classify
3) Instead of 0=benign and 1=malignant, I have used 1=benign and 2=malignant

## Execution 🐉
To run the code, type `python B_Cancer_DL.py`

```
python B_Cancer_DL.py
```
